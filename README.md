# shorinclip

My first bash script.

A wayland clipboard TUI based on `fzf` `wl-clipboad` `cliphist`. 

Use `chafa` for image preview,; `kitty icat` for gif preview when using native kitty, `ffmpegthumbnailer` for video thumb generation.

- some images

    - kitty 

    ![](pictures/kitty2.png)

- installation

    ```
    yay -S shorinclip
    ```
    For best image preview, a terminal which supports kitty image protocal is needed, such as `kitty` or `ghostty`, or you can let chafa handle image preview (maybe low quality).
    
    For example :

    - foot
 
    ![](pictures/foot.png)

    - alacritty

    ![](pictures/alacritty.png)


- usage

    Open cliphist daemon with this command:
  
    ```
    wl-paste --watch cliphist store
    ```
    
    Open tui with this command: `shorinclip` 

    Then it just works. 
    
    Don't forget to setup autostart in your wayland compositor's config file.

    - Niri

        ```
        spawn-at-startup "wl-paste" "--watch" "cliphist" "store"
        ```

    - Hyprland

        ```
        exec-once = wl-paste --watch cliphist store
        ```
